Databases Elasticache 

- Elasticache is web service that may easy to deploy,operate,and scale an 
   in-memory cache in the cloud.
 - this service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you 
   to retrieve information fast, managed,in-memory caches, instaed of relying
   entirely on slower-disk based databases.
 - Elasticache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines
   - MemCached
   - Redis

Amazon Elasticache
  - can be used to significantly improves latency and throughput for many 
    read-heavy application workloads such as social networking,gaming,media sharing
	and Q&A portals
  - or compute intensive workloads such as recommendation engines
  - caching improves application performance by storing critical pieces of data 
    in memory for low-latency access.
  - cached information may include the results of I/O intensive database queries
    or the results of computationally intensive calculations.
	
Types of Elasticache
  - MemCached
    Widely adopted memory object caching system.Elasticache is protocol compliant with 
	MemCached,so popular tools that you use today with existing MemCached environments
	will work seamlessly with the service.
  - Redis
    Popular open-source in-memory key-value store that supports data strcutures such as 
	sorted sets and lists.Elasticache supports Master/Slave replication and Multi AZ
	which can be used to achieve cross AZ redundancy.

Elasticache is good choice if database is particularly read heavy and not prone
to frequent changing.
