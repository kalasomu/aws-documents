EC2 Windows Instance with RAID Group

Creating RAID Volumes and Snapshots

RAID - Redundant Array of Independent Disks
   - RAID 0 - Striped,No Redundancy,Good Performance
   - RAID 1 - Mirrored,Redundancy
   - RAID 5 - Good for reads,bad for writes,AWS doesn't recommend ever putting RAID 5's on EBS
              they are Good in real world,but not in AWS
   - RAID10 - Striped and Mirrored,Good Redundancy,Good Performance
   
Manke a Security Group should have a RDP 3386 Port Opened for the Windows Instances
While Creating the Windows Instance, on the Step 4 'Add Storage'
Click 'Add New Volume'
and Add Extra Volumes of your choice 
  - for ex 4 new Volumes of 8GB Disk Space (SSD)
  - Very Important, these additional Volumes are CHARGED, and NOT FREE
  - then all steps are as usual,and make it sure you have selected the RDP enabled Security Group
  - and if you like you can create,additional KeyPair for this Windows Instance
  
Once Windows Instance Launched, try to RDP and Login to Windows Server
(typing 'mstsc' will bring up the RDP window from your Management PC)

Once you Logged in to the Windows,in Desktop you can chk with File Manager
that All new Volumes will appear as New Drives as D,E,F,and G

Inside Windows Server, Right Click the 'Start' button and Select 'Disk Management'
Disk 1,2,3,4 all will be shown and they are EBS Volumes.

Right Click on the Disk 1,and delete the Volume, and repeat the same for all other Volumes also.
We will be creating Striped Volumes.

Click on Deleted/Unallocated Disk 1, and Right Click and Select 'New Striped Volume'
Click Next and Add all Volumes which are in Available Screen to the Selected Screen
Then Format them with the NTFS File System.

Convert 'Basic Disk to the Dynamic Disk',say 'YES' to the Dialog Box.
Once the Coversion is over, we can see all 4 Volumes will be shown as 'D' only.
and To Increase the Disk I/O,We Create this Striped RAID Volumes. And they will be 
much faster than the Normal Disks.

To Take Snapshots of a RAID Array

- Problem - take a Snapshot,the Snapshot excludes data held in the cache by applications
            and the OS.This tends not to matter on a single volume,however using multiple
			volumes in a RAID Array,this can be a Problem due to interdependencies of the Array.

- Solution - Take an application consistent snapshot

  - Stop the application from writing to disk
  - Flush all caches to the disk
  
    - to do these,three ways are there
	  - freeze the file system
	  - unmount the RAID Array
	  - shutting down the associated EC2 Instance(this would be the easiest one)
