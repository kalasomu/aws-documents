Simple WorkFlow Service SWFS

- Amazon Simple WorkFlow Service is a web service that makes it easy
  to coordinate work across distributed application components.
- Amazon SWF enables applications for a range of use cases,including media
  processesing,web application back-ends,business process workflows,
  and analytics pipelines,to be designed as a coordination of tasks.
- Tasks represent invocations of various processesing steps in an 
  application which can be performed by executable code,web service calls,
  human actions, and scripts.
  
For Example, you can take the scenario that you order a cellphone
in Amazon WebSite.and Backend Processes are handled by SWF

Differences between SWF and SQS 

- SQS has a retention period of 14 days,SWF up to 1 Year for WorkFlow 
  executions.
- Amazon SWF presents a task-oriented API,whereas Amazon SQS offers 
  message-oriented API
- Amazon SWF ensures that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated
  SQS you need to handle duplicated messages and may also need to ensure 
  that a message is processed only once.
- SWF keeps track of all tasks and events in an application.
  SQS you need to implement your own application-level tracking,especially if 
  your application uses multiple queues.
