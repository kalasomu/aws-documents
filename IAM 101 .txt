  -> Security Identity and Compliance -> IAM
  IAM Users Sign in Link is 
  https://178532356.signin.aws.amazon.com/console 
  (number 178532356 is your AWS Account Number assigned to you! 
  can chk that by clicking your name and My Account)
  So customize it with your company name  
 
  Root account is the 'EmailAddress' we use to sign on to the AWS
  Root account gives unlimited access to the cloud
  We dont want all employees to have Root Level Access to work with cloud
  
  So we need to create users inside the AWS and assign roles
  
  -> Activate MFA on your root account
     - this needs to be done,since if someone finds ur email and pwd they can 
	   compromise your account
	 - so physical access can be done with this MFA with mobile
	 
  -> Manage MFA -> Virtual MFA Device and 
                   Physical MFA Device 
				   
				   Select Virtual MFA Device -> next step
				   Google Authenticator can be downloaded and installed in ur cellphone
				   then you will get a QR Code on the PC screen
				   this QR Code needs to be scanned by the phone
				   
				   Authentication Code 1
				   Authentication Code 2 should be filled in 
				   then click Activate MFA 
				   
				   Successfully associated!
				   
Better you can create the Group and Pull Users to the group
that way we can assign the proper permissions to bunch of users

frmo the Left Side Panel we can select 
Dashboard,Groups,Users,Roles,Policies,Account Settings, and So on

Roles -> Create New Role
