AutoScaling Group Creations

Create a normal WebServer on a Amazon AMI Linux Box
by putting these lines while installing in 'Advanced Settings'

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
yum update -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
echo "<html><h1>Hello Welcome to WebServer to test AutoScaling</h1></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html

then once this WebServer has been created,from this server 
try create an image and will use this for the AutoScaling Practice.

Select the Instance -> Action -> Create a Image 
With this Image file,will create Instances for the AutoScaling Group.

EC2 Dashboard -> Launch Configuration 
   -> My AMI(which is running with WebServer) -> Select
   -> t2.micro (free tier)
   -> Create Launch Configuration
      -> Name : MyLaunchConfig-01
	  -> Click Next ->Add Storage (no need to add extra)
	  -> Next: Configure Security Group
	     -> Create one for HTTP and SSH 
	  -> Review
	  -> Create Launch Configuration
	  -> Select an existing KeyPair
	  -> Create Launch Configuration
	  
	  then the second step will open up ! AutoScaling Group 
	  there you can find the 'MyLaunchConfig-01'
	  
	  Create AutoScaling Group
	  Group Name : MyAutoScalingGrp-01
	  Group Size : 1 Instances (is enough)
	  Network : Default VPC
	  Subnet : Select all Subnets Available
	  Next: Configure Scaling Policies 
	click -> Use Scaling Policies to adjust the capacity of this group
	Scale between 1 and 4 Instances
	Increase Group Size :
	 -> Take Action ->Add -> 1 Instances
	 -> Execute Policies When : Add New Alarm 
	    -> Whenever CPU Utilization is >= 30 Percent
		-> For at least Launch 1 Instances for every 1 Minute
		-> Click Create Alarm
	Decrease Group Size :
	  -> Execute Policies When : Add New Alarm 
	    -> Whenever CPU Utilization is <= 20 Percent
		-> For at least Launch 1 Instances for every 1 Minute
		-> Click Create Alarm
		-> Take Action ->Remove -> 1 Instances
	{If CPU Goes above 30% Create Instance,below 20% remove Instance}
		
	 Click Next Configure Notifications
	 Click Add Notifications
	 Send Notifications -> Create Topic -> MyAutoScaleNotification
		Recipients		-> yourname@gmail.com
	 Whenever Instances Launch/terminate/fail to Launch/Fail to terminate
	   CLick Next -> Configure Tags
	   Name : AutoScale-WebServers (Instances Name)
	   Click -> Review
	   CLick -> Create AutoScaling Group

Just Go back to the EC2 Dashboard-> Instances Screen, 
you can see a new Instance is coming up.

- check the AMI ID as 'AutoScale-WebServers AMI' will be shown
  Once the Instance is ready,it will come with the name we
  mentioned on the 'Tags' as 'AutoScale-WebServers'
- Pick the Public IP of the Instance and try access thro 'http'
  you should get the homepage of the AutoScale-WebServers
- try connect to the Instance thro SSH using putty
- then create a file called 'dd.sh' which will contain the 
  stress test lines as 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=50000 count=100000'
  (without quotes),add as many as (same) lines you want
- change permission as 'chmod 755 dd.sh'
- run 'nohup ./dd.sh &' to run it in background
- run it couple of time as well, so that the load must be more 
  on the webserver.
- check it with 'top' command to see the CPU load Percentage
- then you can come back to the AWS EC2 Dashboard, to check 
  whether the Newer Instances are Created Automatically.
  refresh the Dashboard screen couple of time to check.
- Meanwhile you can check 'yourname@gmail.com' to check 
  whether any Notifications has come
- you can check EC2 Dashboard,that another server must be 
  created with the same name as 'AutoScale-WebServers'
  check it with its Public IP,and access it thro 'http'
  you should get the homepage of the AutoScale-WebServers
- since the script is keep on running on that Instance
  you must be seeing the Instances are created Automatically
- same way,if you stop all the scripts running,you must be 
  seeing the Instances are removed Automatically
