Databases - DynamoDB

DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast 
and predictable performance with seamless scalability. 
DynamoDB allows you to create a database table that can store and 
retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. 

- most important in the NoSQL model
- Amazon DynamoDB is fast and flexible NoSQL DB
- for all applications that need consistent,single digit millisecond latency
  at any scale
- fully managed database and supports both document and key-value data models
- flexible data model and reliable performance make it great for mobile,web,
  gaming,ad-tech,IoT and many other applications
- Like a memory stick, there are no moving parts to an SSD (Solid State Drive) 
  Rather,information is stored in microchips. Conversely,a hard disk drive 
  uses a mechanical arm with a read/write head to move around and read 
  information from the right location on a storage platter. 
  This difference is what makes SSD so much faster.

  Stored on SSD Storage 
  Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers
  Eventual consistent Reads (default)
  Strongly Consistent Reads
  
  Eventual consistent Reads (default)
  - Consistent across all copies of data is usually reached within a second
    Repeating a read afetr a short time should return the updated data
	(Best Read Performance)
	
  Strongly Consistent Reads
  - Returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful reponse
    prior to the read
	
DynamoDB Pricing
  - Provisioned Throughput Capacity
    - Write Throughput $0.0065 per hour for every 10 units
	- Read Throughput $0.0065 per hour for every 50 units
	- Storage Cost of $0.25GB per month

Configuring DynamoDB

Services -> Database -> DynamoDB

- Create Table 
  Table name* Classroom
  Primary Key Student-Id -Number 
  
  Table settings -> Use Default Settings
  Create Table 
  
  Select 'Classroom' and Item' from the Tab
  Create and Item 
  Student-Id Number 001
  Append - String - FirstName - User1
  Click SAVE
  
  Create and Item 
  Student-Id Number 002
  Append - String - FirstName - User2
  Append - String - SurName - Live
  Click SAVE
  
  RDS is dynamically adding values/columns and so on
  here nothing like that.
  
  Scan - Filter - SurName - Value -Live , you can search names 
  like this , it will produce the desired result.
  then 
  X table and Start Search , to see all Items in the Table
  
  Metrics Tab will give you the Util Graphs
  Capacity Tab allows you to change the Read Capacity Value and Write Capacity Value
  
  Once Verification Completes, Delete the entries and Table.
