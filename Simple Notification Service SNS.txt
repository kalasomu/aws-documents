Simple Notification Service SNS

- Mobile Section we can see this service
- SNS is we service that akes easy to setup,operate
  and send notifications from the cloud/
- It provides developers with a highly scalable,flexible and
  cost-effective capability to publish messages from an application
  and immdtly deliver them to subscribers or other applications
- push notifications to Apple,Google,Fire OS and WIndows Devices
  as well as Android devices in China with Baidu Cloud Push

What is SNS ?

- besides pushing cloud notifications directly to mobile devices,
  Amazon SNS can also deliver notifications by SMS text messages or email
  to SQS queues,or to any HTTP endpoint.
- SNS notifications can also trigger lambda fucntions.When a message is
  published to an SNS topic that has lambda fucntion subscribed to it
  the lambda fucntion is invoked with the payload of the published message
- the lambda fucntion recieves the message payload as an input parameter 
  and can manipulate the information in the message,publish the message
  to another SNS topics,or send the message to other AWS services.
- SNS allows to group multiple recipients using topics.
- iOS,Android and SMS recipients can be grouped together.
- to prevent messages from being lost,all messages published to 
  Amazon SNS are stored redundantly across multiple AZ
