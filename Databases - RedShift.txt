RedShift - Data Warehousing Service

- Amazon RedShift is fast and powerful,fully managed,petabyte-scale 
  data warehouse service in the cloud
- customers can start small for just $0.25 per hour with no commitments or upfront costs
- can scale to a petabyte or more for $1000 per terabyte per year
- thats less than tenth of most other data warehousing solutions.

OLAP (OnLine Analytic Processing)

- OLAP transaction example 
  - Net Profit for EMEA and Pacific for the digital Radio Product
    Pulls in large nmbers of records
  
  Sum of Radios sold in EMEA
  Sum of Radios sold in Pacific
  Unit Cost of Radio in each region
  Sales Price of each Radio
  Sales Price - Unit Cost
  
  Like these queries can be done in RedShift
  
  Data Warehousing databases use differnet type of architecture
  both from a database perspectve and infrastructure layer.
  
RedShift Configuration 
  
  - Single Node (160GB)
  - MultiNode 
    - Leader Node(manages cleint connections and receives queries)
	- Compute Node (store data and perform queries and computations)
	- up to 128 Compute Nodes possible
	
RedShift is 10 times faster
 - Columnar Data Storage 
   Columnar storage for database tables is an important factor in optimizing
   analytic query performance because it drastically reduces the overall 
   disk I/O requirements and reduces the amount of data you need to load 
   from disk.

 - Advanced Compressions
 - Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)
   enables fast execution of the most complex queries operating on large amounts of data. Multiple compute nodes handle all 
   query processing leading up to final result aggregation, with each core of each 
   node executing the same compiled query segments on portions of the entire data.

RedShift Pricing 
  - Compute Node Hours 
    Total Number of Hours run across all compute modes for billing period
	no charge for leader mode hours,only compute nodes are charged.
	1 unit/per node per hour,so 3 mode data warehouse cluster running 
	persistently for entire month incur 2,160 hours.
  - Backup - you will get charged
  - Data Transfer (only withing VPC,not outside it)
  
RedShift Security
   - everything is encrypted in transit using SSL 
   - envrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption
   - by default RedShift takes care of the key management
     manage your own keys through HSM
	 AWS key management Service
RedShift Availability
   - currently available in certain AZ
   - can restore snapshots to new AZ's in the event of an outage
   
   RedShift is good choice if the database is feeling stress becoz management keep 
running OLAP tranactions on it etc.
