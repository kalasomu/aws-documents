Cloud Formation

What is AWS CloudFormation?

- AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your 
  Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing 
  those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. 
- You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want 
  (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances). 
- AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those 
  resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure 
  AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; AWS CloudFormation 
  handles all of that. 
- you can create or modify an existing AWS CloudFormation template
  A template describes all of your resources and their properties. 
  When you use that template to create an AWS CloudFormation stack, 
  AWS CloudFormation provisions the Auto Scaling group,load balancer, 
  and database for you.
- You can delete the stack just as easily,which deletes all the resources 
  in the stack. 
- By using AWS CloudFormation,you easily manage a collection 
  of resources as a single unit.
