Databases 

In Amazon we can get 
- RDS(OLTP),DynamoDB(No SQL),Elasticache,RedShift(OLAP),DMS 

- RDS(OLTP) Relational Databases are 
  - SQL
  - MySQL
  - PostfreSQL
  - Oracle
  - Aurora
  - MariaDB
- DynamoDB
   - No SQL
RedShift
   - OLAP
Elasticache
   - MemCached
   - Redis

- Relational Databases
  - databases
  - tables
  - row -> each row is a record
  - fields (columns)

Non Relational Databases
- MongoDB,JSON/NoSQL

  Collection = Tables
  Document = Row
  Key Value Pairs = Fields
  
Whats Data WareHousing ?
 - used for business intelligence
 - tools like Cognos,Jaspersoft,SQL Server,
   reporting services,Oracle Hyperion,SAP NetWeaver
 - used to pull in very large and comple data sets.
 - usually used by management to do queries on data 
   (such as current performance vs targets etc)

OLTP vs OLAP
 - OLAP differs from OLTP in terms of ueries they run
 - OLTP Example -> Order Number 2120121
   pulls up a row of data such as Name,date,address to deliver to,
	delivery status etc
 - OLAP transaction Example: Net Profit for EMEA and Pacific for Radio Product
   pulls in large number of records
   
 Data WareHousing databases use diff type of architecture both for a databases
 perspective and infrastructure layer.
 
Elasticache 
 - Elasticache is web service that maes easy to deploy,operate,and scale an 
   in-memory cache in the cloud.
 - this service imporves the performance of web applications by allowing you 
   to retrieve information fast, managed,in-memory caches, instaed of relying
   entirely on slower-disk based databases.
 - Elasticache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines
   - MemCached
   - Redis

DMS - Data Migration Service
 - Allows to migrate the production databases to the AWS
 - Once Migration started,AWS manages all the complexities of the migration
   process like data type transformation,compression,and parallel transfer
   (for fast data transfer)
 - while ensuring the data changes to the source database that occur during the migration
   process are automatically replicated to the targets
 - AWS Schema conversion tool automatically converts the source database schema and 
   majority of custom code,including views,stored procedures,and functions,to a format 
   compatible with the target database.
 - Costlier Oracle Databases can be converted to the less cost/minimum cost db in AWS
